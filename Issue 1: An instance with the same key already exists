82)	When the locationid already exists, we will get a framework message which is not pointing to the location id field. Implement logic in the method ValidationOnLocation which will give the message A location id with the value xxxx already exists when there is a duplicated key.


Tried solution:

  METHOD validationonlocation.

                                )
                      )
                    ) RESULT DATA(lt_location).

    LOOP AT lt_location ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<location>).
      IF <location>-locationid IS INITIAL.
        msg_text = 'Location id cannot be empty'.
        APPEND VALUE #( locationid = <location>-locationid ) TO failed.
